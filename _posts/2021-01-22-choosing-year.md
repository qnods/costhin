excerpt: A suggestion on how to choose accounting year for your company

One of the decision that every business need to make before they start is about accounting year, there are many factors on deciding your accounting year, however…

#### The preferred one in my opinion
For general purpose, I always prefer an accounting year that follow calendar year that start on first of January and end on thirty-first of December. This is the most simpler in my opinion as usually local authority like tax body put example of important dates (like tax submission dates for instance) based on the company that uses <b>calendar year</b>, hence this makes you understand the overall picture easier especially if you have limited background on accounting.  

Other than that, calendar year is also easier in my opinion to be used when you want to measure your business performance on yearly basis and compare it with average industry performance or with your competitors if they make their data publicly available. Since most of the data provided usually will be based on calendar year and you do not need to convert your accounting data to match their data  

#### Other deciding factors
However sometimes there will be situation where non-calendar year is more favorable like to maximize government incentives for new business that is usually calculated based on accounting year.

In this case if you register your business in first of July and your are using calendar year for your accounting year, that means you are at loss of six months of potential incentives that you may get when you are using calendar year and register your business on first of January or using non-calendar year that start on first of July and end on thirtieth of June the following year.

#### Changing your accounting year
Depending on the country, it is possible to change your accounting year from calendar year to non-calendar year and vice versa. You may want to check with your local authority on this matter. However, kindly take note, depending on the country’s requirement and your number of transactions, the whole process can be either relatively easy or quite daunting for your accounting team.
