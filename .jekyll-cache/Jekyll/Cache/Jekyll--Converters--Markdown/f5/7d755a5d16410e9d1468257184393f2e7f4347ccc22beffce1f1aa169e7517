      "content": "This is a note that I write based on couple on things that I do before I start doing any reconciliation. Reconciliation is the process of matching various transactions in accounting. The most common one is when you try to match amount on your issued invoice and the actual amount that your client paid or when you try to match the amount sent from your credit card provider like Stripe or PayPal to your bank account. Reconciliation, can be frustrating especially if you have limited experience on doing accounting, but it is still doable and can be quite monotonous once you have discovered the pattern.\n\nAccount assessment\nStart with check on all available statement that you have and need to be reconciliated. While most people aware that they have bank account where they receive payment from their customer, they sometimes forget other accounts that act as intermediary or the amount is too little. This can be statement from your credit card provider or cash in hand or something similar. All of those need to be accounted into your reconciliation.\n\nAnalyze the first point of contact of your income\nIf you receive payment via bank transfer, your first point of contact is your bank account so you should compare invoice issued with the amount received on your bank. However, if you receive payment via credit card provider like Stripe or PayPal and they transfer the money to your bank account at the later date, your first point of contact is your credit card provider like Stripe or PayPal and you should compare your invoice issued with the amount received on your Stripe or PayPal. The money that the credit card provider transfer to your bank account at the later date should be treated as internal transfer between your company’s different account.\n\nStatement date vs Post /Value date\nMost of the time, your bank account or statement from your credit card provider will have two different date. The first one is statement date which indicates when the transaction appears on your statement and the second one is post / value date which indicates when the transaction is actually received on your account. So, if your client says, they have paid you on 18 January 2021, you should be able to find the transaction on or after the post / value date of 18 January 2021 instead of try find the transaction based on the statement date.\n\nFind the “common ground”\nAlthough reconciliation is about matching between two different accounts, that does not mean you can only make a good guess which is transaction is which one solely based on amount received and transaction date. Most of the bank or credit card provider nowadays also provide expanded version of your statement that shows additional information, like the invoice number that your client enters when making payment or your client’s email in the case of credit card provider, they are providing extra column that can help you to match the transaction with your invoice list or your other statement. You can simply get all of these extra info by downloading the CSV version of your statement from your internet banking or your online account.\n\nFormula and Pivot Table for Excel or Google Sheet\nWhile you can do manual reconciliation from checking line by line of your two bank accounts, you can accelerate the matching process by learning VLOOKUP or Pivot Table. Simply just search on Google and you will find many explanations for this formula as well.\n",

      "title": "Choosing Accounting Year",
      "author": "",
      "category": "",
      "content": "One of the decision that every business need to make before they start is about accounting year, there are many factors on deciding your accounting year, however…\n\nThe preferred one in my opinion\nFor general purpose, I always prefer an accounting year that follow calendar year that start on first of January and end on thirty-first of December. This is the most simpler in my opinion as usually local authority like tax body put example of important dates (like tax submission dates for instance) based on the company that uses calendar year, hence this makes you understand the overall picture easier especially if you have limited background on accounting.\n\nOther than that, calendar year is also easier in my opinion to be used when you want to measure your business performance on yearly basis and compare it with average industry performance or with your competitors if they make their data publicly available. Since most of the data provided usually will be based on calendar year and you do not need to convert your accounting data to match their data\n\nOther deciding factors\nHowever sometimes there will be situation where non-calendar year is more favorable like to maximize government incentives for new business that is usually calculated based on accounting year.\n\nIn this case if you register your business in first of July and your are using calendar year for your accounting year, that means you are at loss of six months of potential incentives that you may get when you are using calendar year and register your business on first of January or using non-calendar year that start on first of July and end on thirtieth of June the following year.\n\nChanging your accounting year\nDepending on the country, it is possible to change your accounting year from calendar year to non-calendar year and vice versa. You may want to check with your local authority on this matter. However, kindly take note, depending on the country’s requirement and your number of transactions, the whole process can be either relatively easy or quite daunting for your accounting team.\n",

      "content": "In the past, I have made accounting system for few companies that is created using spreadsheet as its core. Most of thems are customized according to what the company and its management team want to see in term of their financial perfomance. As I work with more companies, I improve the system bit by bit and recently as I go in depth with coding I am looking for a way to an accounting system that I have made in the past with my new interest in coding.\n\nHence, I do this project out of my curiosity. I try to create accounting system on the web app for a freelancer. The web app is created using Google App Script, a derivative of JavaScript in my opinion. The database is stored on Google Sheet files and consisted of two layers of Google Sheet. After user click the submit button, the data will be store in database file and immediately will be sent to reporting file for it to be processed into various accounting report. Kindly take note whatever you see in this post is the dummy version. If you are interested to know more about the working version, feel free to email me at edward@costhin.com\n\nThe main interface of the web app\nAs this is just for fun project, I just created this simple interface to test the data input. Once again this is a dummy web app, and whatever is inputted here will not appear on the databases that I will show later.\n\n\n\nFirst layer : database file\nAfter a user has inputted the data on the web app, the data will be sent to this file first. This is also where the data can be altered if there is mistakes during the data input on the web app. And since this is built on the Google Sheet, access can be restricted either by specific row, column, cells, or even by users.\n\n\n\nClient and Vendor is quite self-explanatory.
